Following labs are for Computational Sound, BC3430, taught by Mark Santolucito.

Lab1: https://pruyontrarakk.github.io/computational_sound/lab1/lab1.html 
- Using the Web Audio API to create a keyboard, the user can use keys on the keyboard to play different notes and can choose between one of four waveforms. ADSR envelopes are used to avoid zero-ing clicks.

Lab 2: https://pruyontrarakk.github.io/computational_sound/lab2/lab2.html
- Using the Web Audio API to create a keyboard, the user can choose between Additive synthesis, AM synthesis, and FM synthesis. Various parameters can be adjusted.  

Lab 3: https://pruyontrarakk.github.io/computational_sound/lab3/lab3.html
- Created different audio effects utilizing resonant high pass filters, resonant low pass filters, band-pass filters, white noise, and brown noise.

Lab 4: https://pruyontrarakk.github.io/computational_sound/lab4/lab4.html
- Coded a minimal command-based live coding engine where users can make their own sound patterns.
