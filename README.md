# computational_sound

This lab was done for Computational Sound, BC3430, taught by Mark Santolucito.

Lab1: https://pruyontrarakk.github.io/computational_sound/lab1/lab1.html 
- I built by own keyboard on the web using the Web Audio API. The user can use keys on the keyboard to play different notes and can choose between one of four waveforms. ADSR envelopes are used to avoid zero-ing clicks.

Lab 2: https://pruyontrarakk.github.io/computational_sound/lab2/lab2.html
- Using the Web Audio API to create a keyboard, the user can choose between Additive synthesis, AM synthesis, and FM synthesis. Various parameters can be adjusted.
