        <p><b>Fire Sounds Explanation</b></p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">The sound that I chose to recreate is fire, which inludes 3 parts to the sound on top of 
        the white noise: the hissing, the crackling, and the lapping. Below is the audio signal flow graph created by the WebAudio 
        visualizer Chrome extention. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Hissing:</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I started off by making two oscillators of different waveforms (square and triangle) which are 
            connected to a gain node to create somewhat "sporatic" hissing sounds. I chose to use two oscillators instead of just one
            because occasional overlap between the two oscillators can create irregularities in both the sound and timing, which
            mimics the unpredictable nature of fire. On the white noise, I used a low-pass filter which filtered out
            frequencies above 1 Hz and a high-pass filter which filtered out frequencies below 1000 Hz to really create the
            hissing sound. Overall, the hissing, although an important characteristic of fire, seems the most quiet as it blends 
            a bit into the lapping noise. </p>
        <br> <br>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Crackling:</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">When trying to do the crackling noises, I needed to make sure that they were short and sharp, and
        that they would occur at random times. To do that, I used several SetInterval functions with the amplitude envelope inside in 
        order to make various crackles with different amplitides and decay times for a more realistic sound. By using more than one SetInterval
        function with the interval times set differently for each one, it allowed me to make the crackling more randomly placed. Also,
        even though I set the amplitudes of each of the crackles in the SetInterval functions to be different, I made sure that they were
        not too loud as these short, sudden noises stand out. </p>
        <br> <br>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Lapping:</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I start off by using a bandpass filter, allowing only frequencies of around 30 Hz to pass through
        with a bandwidth of 5Hz. This output is then passed through a highpass filter that further shapes the sound by removing any frequencies 
        lower than 25 Hz. In addition, I also used a wave shaper to introduce distortion by nonlinearly altering the waveform. The distortion
        created helps further the lapping sound as it helps reduce the intensity of the sound if it gets too high. I connected all of this to 
        the white noise. To make sure that this lapping is louder than the hissing and the crackling, I amplified the audio signal by 8. </p>
